            <!---->
            <p id="start">I am Malik Phillips and I am located Southern California!</p>
            <p>Just a few things about myself are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I love animals, especially dogs. I mean, who doesn't right?</li>
                <li>Being in nature is my therapy.</li>
                <li>I play the violin.</li>
            </ul>

               <!--About me section-->
             <h2>More About Me</h2>
             <p>I haven't always been a outgoing and confident person. I had to challenge myself to breakaway from the shyness, because I realized that in the long run I was just holding myself back. Now I love meeting new people and getting 
                the chance to learn from those interactions. Once I accomplished that I became a much better team player and more involved whenever I needed to work in groups.</p> 
             <p>After highschool, I did about two years of traditional college to work towards my BS in Computer Science. I love the experience I gained from
             my time there, however; I always felt there was a better path to achieve my goal of becoming a full time software developer, and I found that opportunity at <a href='https://www.thinkful.com/'>Thinkful.</a>.</p>
             <p>Programming is something I have genuinely have a passion for and I'm always striving to become the best developer that I can be. I love to challenge myself
             to learn new things and constantly grow my skills not just as a developer, but also as a person.</p>
